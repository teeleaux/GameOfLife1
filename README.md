Simple Game of Life which is based on Conway's Game of Life.

Usage: python3 hovedprogram.py

This runs from the terminal and has no graphical user interface. In order to run the game you can type into your terminal: python3 hovedprogram.py

Code is written in Norwegian, while gameplay language is in English.

This starts the game. You can choose how many rows and columns the gameboard will have. It is beneficial to have more than 10 rows and columns in order to see a pattern develop.
